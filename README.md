## Bitespeed Backend Task: Identity Reconciliation

This service resolves and unifies customer identities using their email and/or phone number.  
It helps Bitespeed identify returning customers across multiple purchases on FluxKart.com, even when partial contact information is available.

### 🔍 Problem Statement

FluxKart checkout events always contain either an **email** or a **phoneNumber**.  
However, customers may use different combinations of these over time.  
To maintain a single source of truth, Bitespeed stores and links related contacts in a **relational database** using a `Contact` table.

This project implements the logic to:
- Identify if the contact already exists.
- Link contacts that refer to the same person.
- Maintain primary/secondary relationships for unified identity tracking.

## 🚀 Tech Stack

- **Node.js** with **TypeScript**
- **PostgreSQL** (relational identity graph)
- **Express.js**
- **Render.com** for hosting
- **pg** PostgreSQL driver

```bash
git clone https://github.com/priyanka2604/customer-identity-service.git
cd customer-identity-service
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Create a .env file:
```env
DATABASE_URL=postgres://username:password@localhost:5432/customer_identity
PORT=3000
```

4. Create the contact table:
```bash
psql $DATABASE_URL -f migrations/create_contact_table.sql

### 🧪 API Endpoint: /identify
➤ POST /identify
```json
{
  "email": "george@example.com",
  "phoneNumber": "9999999999"
}
```

✅ Response:
```json
{
  "contact": {
    "primaryContactId": 1,
    "emails": ["george@example.com"],
    "phoneNumbers": ["9999999999"],
    "secondaryContactIds": [2, 3]
  }
}
```

- Automatically creates and links secondary contacts based on overlapping fields

- Ensures there is only one primary identity
